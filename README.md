# Grammer Generator
## Generator Usage
Type 1, 2, or 3 to generate a list of random names for my D&D world of Torr.
1 is draconic names using my created draconic language. They are segmented and quick.
2 is hobgoblin names, intended to be more gruff.
3 is elvish names, lighter and more melodic

## Construction
The Elvish names have three random thirds to their first names, and two random halfs to their second.
The Hobgoblin names have a first name comprised of two syllables, and last names with one adjective and one noun.
The Dragon names were tougher, as they have a complex construction. One noun is chosen, but the modifier is either a noun, adverb, or adjective. This other term is added to the end, but the translation is modified to make the sentence flow in english.

## Reflection
The most difficult item for me was the creation of the dragon names. There were a lot of minute details I wanted to capture that I felt I couldn't do justice to. Especially the layout of the nouns vs adverbs vs adjectives. However, in all, I found it to be an enjoyable experience and a tool I can use in the future. I would also refine the elvish names to be generated a little more pleasently had I the time.
